## Common Misconceptions

### "Jenkins is Only for Java"
- **Reality**: Supports all major programming languages
- **Evidence**: Plugins for .NET, Python, Node.js, Go, etc.

### "Jenkins is Difficult to Learn"
- **Reality**: Has learning curve but extensive documentation
- **Evidence**: Large community, tutorials, and training available

### "Jenkins is Not Secure"
- **Reality**: Provides comprehensive security features
- **Evidence**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, audit trails

### "Jenkins is Outdated"
- **Reality**: Actively developed with modern features
- **Evidence**: Regular releases, cloud-native features, modern UI
